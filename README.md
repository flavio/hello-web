This is a simple "Hello world" application that can be used container-related
demos.

The message showed by the application can be changed by setting the `HELLO_MSG`
environment variable.

The application listens by default on port `8000`. This can be changed by
setting a different port number via the `HELLO_PORT` environment variable.
